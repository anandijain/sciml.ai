# SciML Developer Programs

SciML has many on-going developer programs for helping fund open source work.
Opportunities are available for everyone, all the way from students looking to
learn to career scientists looking to fund dedicated open source time. Below
are our major developer programs with more information on how to get involved.

## Google Summer of Code

The SciML organization is a partner organization for Google Summer of Code
under the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) umbrella. In this summer program,
students are paid to work on various SciML open source software repositories.
Each of the students are paired with a team of mentors to teaching them various
aspects of computational science, from numerical differential equations and
scientific machine learning, to parallel and symbolic-numeric computing.

To get started, take a look at the project lists and contact one of the mentors
associated with the project.

#### Projects Lists

- [General Numerics](/gsoc/gsoc_numerics)
- [Numerical Differential Equations](/gsoc/gsoc_diffeq)
- [Scientific Machine Learning](/gsoc/gsoc_sciml)
- [Symbolic-Numeric Computing](/gsoc/gsoc_symbolic)

## MLH Summer Fellowship

The SciML organization partners with the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/)
to sponsor students over the summer for open source development. Check out the
MLH Fellowship website for more information on getting involved.

## NumFOCUS Small Development Grants

Semi-quarterly NumFOCUS puts out a call for small development grants.
The SciML organization puts out a call for proposals from the community
for grant proposals. There are no restrictions on what the funding can be used
for. Code development, documentation work, educational, sustainability, and
diversity initiatives, or other types of projects are all eligible.
Since only one application can be put in for the Julia project, an internal
selection process is used to determine which proposals will be submitted to
NumFOCUS. For examples of grants that have been funded and more information,
see the
[NumFOCUS small development grants](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants)
page.

Up to USD 5,000 is available per proposal. The total allocated funding for
NumFOCUS in 2021 is USD 53,000 for each of the three cycles, with USD 11,000
for off cycle grants. NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliated projects may receive
upto two grants per year and can submit one application per cycle.

If you are interested, please get in contact with Chris Rackauckas.
